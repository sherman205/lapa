servingSize: "One 9 inch pie"
totalTime: "1 hour 30 minutes"
list_1: "Pie dough"
list_2: "Pie filling"
ingredients:
    - 2½ cups flour
    - 2 tablespoons cold water
    - 1 cup unsalted frozen butter, grated
    - ½ cup buttermilk
    - 1 tablespoon sugar
    - 1 teaspoon salt
    - 1 egg, for the egg wash 
instructions:
    - Combine flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter into the flour mixture and use a fork to mix in any lumps of butter until the flour is fine and crumbly.
    - Add the buttermilk and using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix until the dough starts to come together. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water to help the dough come together.
    - Divide the dough into half and form each into a flattened desk and store in the fridge until ready to bake.
ingredients_list_2:
    - 1 cup peeled potato, cubed
    - ⅓ cup onion, diced
    - 1 cup carrots, sliced
    - ¼ cup unsalted butter
    - 2 cloves garlic, grated
    - ½ cup flour
    - ¾ cup milk
    - 2 cups cooked chicken, shredded
    - 1 cup frozen peas
    - 1½ cups broth (chicken or vegetable)
    - 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
    - 1½ teaspoons fresh thyme, leaves only
instructions_list_2:
    - Melt the ¼ cup of butter in a medium saucepan over medium high heat.
    - Add the potatoes, carrots, and onion and cook until coated with butter and slightly tender, stirring occasionally. Then add in the grated garlic and mix together.
    - With a wooden spoon, gradually stir in the milk, broth, flour, and parsley and thyme. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened, about 3 minutes.
    - Remove from the heat and add in the cooked shredded chicken and peas. Mix to combine.
    - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out one of the pie dough disks into a circle, about ¼” thick, and large enough to place in a 9” pie dish. Fill the pie with the chicken pot pie filling.
    - Roll out the second pie dough disk to the same size and place over the filling. Trim the extra pie dough with a knife and seal the edges by crimping with a fork. Cut slits in the center of the pie crust for ventilation.
    - Place in the oven and bake for 45 minutes, until the crust is flaky and golden brown.
    - Cool slightly, cut into slices, and enjoy!

Apparently chicken pot pie is said to have originated in Greece and early American settlers took such a liking to this dish that they brought it with them when they settled America in the 19th century. Not really sure how future American settlers interacted with the Greek… but oh well. Regardless whether this is fact or fiction, many cultures today all have a type of meat pie as part of their cuisine and culture.

And speaking of culture, we’re going through such a momentous time in our nation’s history that it would be wrong not to write about it. We have been spending all week learning and standing with the black movement in support of the #blacklivesmatter movement that’s taking the entire world by storm. It is such a powerful thing to have the entire world stand up in support of equality and justice for the black community. I just hope that everyone who listens realizes the importance of this and that we can all make some serious changes around here.

So even though we are starting to publish recipes again, it doesn’t diminish the importance of the Black Lives Matter movement and our support of it. In fact, we are still learning and supporting and doing anything we can. But in the meantime, feel free to indulge in this delicious and easy chicken pot pie to nourish yourselves so that you can also get back out there and show support!

It’s going to rain all week (surprise surprise, Portland) and this is the perfect thing to eat when it’s slightly chilly outside. It’s June, but sometimes we just get these really weird weeks where it dips back down to the 50s and I’m just cold all the time. So I’ll be eating a ton of warm foods, like this comforting chicken pot pie.
