Sometimes going through all that trouble of making pizza dough (or even using store-bought) is annoying. Basically using raw pizza dough would make this recipe take way longer than 20 minutes. And if you're in a hurry and craving pizza, this is super easy and quick to make, without sacrificing taste!

Just pick up some Greek pita flatbread from the grocery store, along with your favorite toppings, and you got yourself a meal. I used to make this all the time in college. It's quite the upgrade from buying cup ramen at the store and living off that for a week straight. With this pizza, I'm not actually poisoning my body, ya know?

This recipe is pretty healthy, if you don't count all the cheese I guess. And you get to choose all your toppings, so you know exactly what goes on your pizza and what you're putting into your body. There isn't anything wrong with satisfying a little pizza craving!

You could even swap out the Greek pita flatbread for a sprouted wheat version. We were at Costco (what else is new) a few weeks ago and they were selling sprouted wheat Greek pita! SO healthy and you can't even tell the difference. These pizzas were actually made using that sprouted wheat pita, shhh.
