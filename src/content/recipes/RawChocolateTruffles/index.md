If you want to satisfy your chocolate craving quickly while not going over your calorie count for the day, these truffles are your go-to! We absolutely love these and we don't even feel bad eating them. They have a very rich chocolate flavor and you can't even tell there's no artificial sweetener in here.

Basically, you just throw all the ingredients into a food processor, wait for them to form a big sticky mess, and roll them into little balls. Then you can keep them in the fridge and pop one (or several) into your mouth anytime your body needs some sweetness. And there's really nothing to it!

And just because I'm in a fun fact kind of mood, here are some fun facts about chocolate that will definitely motivate you to make some of these truffles:

1. Chocolate is a vegetable! -- And here's why: chocolate grows on the cacao tree, which is technically a type of evergreen tree. So that makes chocolate a vegetable, right? And therefore very healthy ;)

2. Cacao was once used as money -- it was that valuable in the Aztec society!

3. The traditional way chocolate was consumed was in liquid form -- that means, hot chocolate! Solid chocolate bars weren't invented until the 1800s, folks!

Hope you all enjoyed that! But what are you waiting for? Go try out these truffles!
