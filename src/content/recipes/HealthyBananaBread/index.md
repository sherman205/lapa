description: "Tastes just like the banana bread you know and love, but without refined sugar and vegetable oils."
content: "This popular bread made from ripe mashed bananas never gets old! Some people make it plain and simple and others add different flavors to it, like chocolate or cream cheese frosting. This recipe is a pretty plain and simple banana bread, but that doesn't mean it's plain and boring. 
It tastes great AND it's made with an array of slightly healthier ingredients. You'll find no butter or refined sugar here -- just coconut oil and maple syrup as a sweetener. And since I like my banana bread with a little added texture, I always throw in some walnuts. 
One of the first things I learned how to bake was banana bread. Or at least it's one of the most distinct memories I have of baking as a child. I used to default to making two types of baked goods -- lemon squares or banana bread. But I definitely used to make banana bread way more often. And of course I would bake it with all the butter and sugar in the world. Not this time though!
You just can't go wrong with this good ole fashioned banana bread. Maybe you'll see a fancier banana bread from us next time! But for now, bake and enjoy!"
