servingSize: "1 loaf"
totalTime: "1 hour"
ingredients:
    - 2 cups flour
    - 2 eggs
    - ½ cup maple syrup
    - ⅓ cup coconut oil, melted
    - 2 medium old bananas, mashed
    - ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
    - ¼ cup milk
    - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    - 1 teaspoon baking soda
    - ½ teaspoon salt
    - ½ cup chopped walnuts
instructions:
    - Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and line a 9x5 inch loaf pan with parchment paper. 
    - In a large bowl, whisk together the coconut oil and maple syrup until it thickens. Then add the eggs and mix well. Then whisk in the mashed bananas and milk. 
    - Add the baking soda, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt into the banana mixture and combine well. 
    - Finally add in the flour and stir with a large spoon to avoid the batter getting stuck in your whisk. Add in the chopped walnuts.
    - Pour the batter into the loaf pan and place in the oven for about 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
    - Let cool in the loaf pan for about 10 minutes before taking the banana bread out and allow it to finish cooling on a cooling rack. 
    - Slice a few thick slices and enjoy with some almond butter or just on its own!

This popular bread made from ripe mashed bananas never gets old! Some people make it plain and simple and others add different flavors to it, like chocolate or cream cheese frosting. This recipe is a pretty plain and simple banana bread, but that doesn't mean it's plain and boring.

It tastes great AND it's made with an array of slightly healthier ingredients. You'll find no butter or refined sugar here -- just coconut oil and maple syrup as a sweetener. And since I like my banana bread with a little added texture, I always throw in some walnuts.

One of the first things I learned how to bake was banana bread. Or at least it's one of the most distinct memories I have of baking as a child. I used to default to making two types of baked goods -- lemon squares or banana bread. But I definitely used to make banana bread way more often. And of course I would bake it with all the butter and sugar in the world. Not this time though!
You just can't go wrong with this good ole fashioned banana bread. Maybe you'll see a fancier banana bread from us next time! But for now, bake and enjoy!
