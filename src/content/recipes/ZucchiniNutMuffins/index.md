description: "A healthy alternative to muffins --  they're guiltless and with a touch of honey!"
servingSize: "6 muffins"
totalTime: "40 minutes"
ingredients:
    - 1 cup flour
    - ¾ cup zucchini, grated (about 1 small zucchini)
    - 2½ tablespoons melted coconut oil
    - ¼ cup honey
    - 1 egg
    - ½ cup walnuts, chopped (some of this will go towards the topping!)
    - ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
    - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    - ½ teaspoon baking powder
    - ¼ teaspoon baking soda
    - ⅓ cup buttermilk (or ⅓ cup milk + 2 teaspoons vinegar)
    - Pinch of cloves
    - Salt to taste
instructions:
    - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare your muffin tin by lining each cup with muffin paper liner and spray each with cooking spray. 
    - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together honey and coconut oil. Then add in the egg and mix well. 
    - Add the buttermilk (or substitute with milk + vinegar), as well as the baking soda, baking powder, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Whisk until combined. 
    - Before mixing in the grated zucchini, make sure you remove as much of the moisture as you can by squeezing it out in a towel. Then add in the zucchini to the bowl and mix with a wooden spoon.
    - Finally, add in the flour. The mixture should be slightly thicker and more like a batter. Fold in the chopped nuts, if desired. 
    - Pour the batter evenly into each of the 6 muffin cups. Top with more crumbled walnuts for a nice topping. 
    - Place into the oven and bake for about 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. 
    - Let the muffins cool for about 10 minutes in their tin, before removing them and placing them on a cooling rack. Enjoy!

Sometimes the biggest struggle in the world is wanting to eat all the full-fat food out there, but not gain weight. It's a problem. We usually try to stick to the most traditional way of making our food. That means our pie crusts and scones and other baked goods are going to be full-fat, with all that butter.

But other times, we're tired of that and don't want to worry too much about counting calories. (Yes it affects us all as we get older. Surprise surprise). For these zucchini nut muffins, we wanted to cut out using a ton of butter or oil as well as refined sugar. Plus you feel so much better eating this and thinking "wow, okay these taste great but I don't have to feel bad about it."

Coconut oil is a given here -- this is one of the best ways to cut out butter and not ruin the zucchini muffin taste. And then of course adding honey blends nicely with cinnamon and vanilla, and you almost can't even tell it's replacing the sugar! Either way these honey zucchini muffins taste great.

Oh and if you're not allergic to nuts, adding some chopped walnuts to these really makes the difference -- it gives these muffins that bite that brings everything together. Texture is very important too!
