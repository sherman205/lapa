ingredients:
    - 1 cup raw almonds
    - 5 cups drinking water
    - 4-6 pitted dates
    - ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
    - ½ teaspoon cinnamon
instructions:
    - Soak the almonds in a bowl of water to soften them up to blend. You can do this overnight or over the course of an hour or so. 
    - Add the almonds, water, dates, vanilla extract, and cinnamon into a blender. You can alter how many dates to add, based on your preferred level of sweetness.

    - Strain the almond pulp through a cheesecloth or nut milk bag, collecting the milk in a bowl. Squeeze the bag to extract as much almond milk as possible.

This recipe made its way into my kitchen toolbox, thanks to my sister. I remember when she first started making almond milk herself, I was surprised. I thought, 'isn't that hard?' And why bother, if you can just go buy it from the grocery store?

She used to make it so often, that I was intrigued. And the flavor was amazing! It just tasted so different from store-bought almond milk. I don't think I could ever go back. It was life-changing. I wasn't really big into drinking plant-based milk, but since she is a ballerina, she was always finding ways to stay slim (and cow's milk has so much added sugar and calories that she had stopped drinking it).

Probably every recipe to make almond milk uses basically the same ingredients, but this is the recipe I use all the time now. The cinnamon and vanilla give it that unique flavor profile I've come to enjoy.

As long as you have a blender and a cheese cloth (or nut milk bag), making your own almond milk is fast and easy! Since Ryan and I make it so often now, the process of actually making the milk takes about 5 minutes! That's it! And then you have fresh almond milk in your fridge. You should probably drink it within a week though, since it will go bad a lot sooner than store-bought almond milk.

The cool thing about this recipe is you could definitely experiment with it a bit. Too much sweetness? Tone down the dates. Don't like cinnamon? Omit it from the recipe. And you could add whatever you want to it. Maybe some chocolate almond milk or turmeric almond milk would be tasty. We'll definitely keep experimenting on this and keep you guys updated!
