I’m not too sure why these cookies are called “Russian tea cakes”. I mean they’re cookies first of all. And second, no one seems to know why they’re “Russian”. My family (from Russia) has never heard of them and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of information on the internet as to where they’re from.

People also tend to call them snowball cookies or Mexican wedding cookies. EIther way, one thing’s for sure -- they’re delicious! My favorite part is the tiny pieces of almond that you can feel as you bite down into the powdery, crumbly shortbread.

This is definitely the kind of cookie that you add to your Christmas cookie collection. It’s a solid go-to. And they’re super easy to make. As long as you make the cookies all the same size, they’re going to look fantastic :)

OH, and these are perfect with tea! Hope you get to have some proper tea time now with these tea cakes up your sleeve!
