Get ready to have your minds blown. These chocolate brownies are the richest and chocolatiest (is that even a word?) ones you've ever had! And we love that they only consist of six ingredients! You'll never want to make any other brownie recipe and you most definitely won't want to buy them from the store ever again.

If you haven't started making your brownies using baking chocolate bars, now is the time to start. No more of those chocolate chips or that cocoa powder. It just isn't the same. Just watching and smelling the chocolate bar melting down into chocolatey goodness is heaven.

Obviously there are a ton of brownie recipes out there, so why choose this one? Well, first, it runs in the family. Ryan's mom has been making these ever since he can remember, and obviously he won't have any other brownies. Momma always knows best!

These are brownies that have been tested and tried for many years. They're brownies you can trust! So naturally, we turn to these for our staple brownie recipe. And second, they are sooo simple to make.

Friends have asked us what the hell we put into these, because they're so damn good. They're probably as simple as it gets without sacrificing taste. You won't ever need to make brownies from the box again.

Also, we're going to teach you a little trick about brownies here, passed down by Ryan's mom. So what is the trick behind cutting brownies and not having the tops crumble? Flip that brownie sheet upside down!

Brownies form a shell-like crust on the top (which is personally our favorite part) and we don't want to ruin that by cutting through that. When they come out of the oven, let them cool slightly, before flipping them upside down onto a cooling rack. Once they have cooled completely, cut the brownies while they're upside down. And then you can flip them right side up and they'll be pretty and unharmed --  yay!

We hope you enjoy baking and eating these just as much as we have over the years! Bring these to your next potluck or get-together with family or friends. These bad boys will not disappoint.
