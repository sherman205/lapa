servingSize: "1 loaf"
totalTime: "65 minutes"
ingredients:
  - 2 teaspoons loose leaf earl grey lavender tea
  - 2 eggs
  - 1½ cups flour
  - 1½ teaspoons baking powder
  - ½ cup sugar
  - ¼ cup honey
  - ⅔ cup milk
  - ½ cup unsalted butter, room temperature
  - 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
  - ¼ teaspoon sea salt
instructions:
  - Infuse the milk with 1 teaspoon of Earl Grey lavender tea by heating the milk in the microwave and adding the tea leaves in a strainer. Let this steep for 10 minutes before removing the tea strainer.
  - In a small bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Grind the remaining teaspoon of loose leaf tea into a fine powder and stir into the flour mixture.
  - In a larger bowl, beat the sugar and butter together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the honey, eggs, and vanilla and continue mixing until well combined.
  - Add in the tea-infused milk. Stir in the flour in ½ cup increments, mixing continuously until all the flour is used up and the mixture resembles a smooth batter.
  - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
  - Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake for about 50 minutes, or until the loaf is nicely browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 
  - Let the loaf cool in the pan before taking it out to cool on a cooling rack completely. 
  - Cut into slices and enjoy with some tea!

For me, this is straight out of an afternoon tea time fairytale. This light and airy tea loaf combines the best aromatic flavors of bergamot and lavender together to create a heavenly cake. These flavors always remind me of a slightly rainy spring morning, a slow start to the day, drinking tea and eating this cake.

Earl grey tea is one of my favorites; it’s super comforting and I do enjoy that strong, powerful taste. I find that some people either really love it or they don’t care for it. If you like the taste of bergamot too, then you’ll love this tea loaf. We used an earl grey lavender loose leaf tea blend and infused the batter with this flavor. 

If you don’t have this loose leaf tea available, you can also mix together loose leaf Earl Grey tea and loose leaf lavender together. If you don’t have either of these things, tea bags will also probably work, but you’ll have to experiment with how much to steep the tea to give it enough strength to flavor the loaf.

I’m a big fan of experimenting with tea flavors in desserts, so you can be sure that we’ll be trying more desserts with other tea flavors. Matcha, chai, rose, etc. So many options!
