servingSize: "4 servings"
totalTime: "30 minutes"
ingredients:
    - ½ yellow onion, cut into slices
    - 4 cups vegetable broth
    - 5 cups peas, frozen or fresh
    - 1 cup heavy cream
    - 2 cloves garlic, grated
    - ½ tablespoon chopped parsley
    - 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary, needles only
    - Pinch of cayenne pepper
    - Salt, to taste
    - Pepper, to taste
instructions:
    - In a 4 quart soup pot, heat some olive oil. Add in the chopped onion and 1 clove of grated garlic and cook over moderate heat until the onions are softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. 
    - Add the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Season the broth with the parsley and the needles from one sprig of rosemary and a pinch of salt. 
    - Add the peas into the broth and cook until they are tender, about 4 minutes. It is important to not overcook the peas, otherwise the soup will lose its bright green color.
    - Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until it reaches a thick, potage-like consistency and all the vegetables are broken down into small pieces. 
    - Season the soup one final time with salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste.
    - To make the rosemary garlic cream swirl, heat a small saucepan on the stove. Add in the heavy cream, the remaining clove of grated garlic, and the needles from another rosemary sprig and bring to a boil. 
    - Simmer over low heat until the cream is reduced by half, or about 5 minutes. Add some salt to season. 
    - Strain the garlic cream and allow to cool slightly. 
    - Ladle soup into bowls and swirl the garlic cream on top. Serve warm and enjoy!

This soup has the fastest cooking time we've ever seen. The peas only cook for about 5 minutes -- it's amazing. Soups are just one of those things where you usually have to cook it for a while before it's ready. But not this one! Since preserving the bright green color of the peas is very important, we definitely don't want to overcook it. If you do, your soup will turn muddy green and brown (kind of more like split pea soup).

I wasn't a huge fan of peas growing up, but this soup has definitely changed my mind. Peas have such an interesting texture and flavor profile. They're slightly sweet and starchy and crunchy at the same time. So strange! But I am becoming more of a fan these days.

Not to mention, peas have amazing health benefits. They are packed with protein and tons of vitamins and minerals. Maybe that's why we were always forced to eat them as children? Either way, this soup packs all those nutrients into one beautiful green bowl.

If you're looking for a healthy and tasty spring soup, look no further! Try this out and make sure you let us know how it goes!
