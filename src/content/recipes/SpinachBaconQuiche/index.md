description: "A cheesy and herbed quiche that packs all the main food groups into one pie."
servingSize: "One 9 inch quiche"
totalTime: "80 minutes"
list_1: "Quiche dough"
list_2: "Quiche filling"
ingredients:
    - 2 cups flour
    - 1 teaspoon sea salt
    - ½ cup ice water
    - ½ cup olive oil
instructions:
    - In a bowl, mix together the flour and salt with a fork. 
    - In a separate bowl, mix the olive oil and cold water together until it combines. Then pour the mixture into the flour. 
    - Once the dough starts to come together, use your hands to form it into a ball. 
    - Store in the fridge for a few hours so it is easier to roll out. 
    - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
    - Roll out the dough to ¼” thick and form into the tart or pie pan. Trim away excess dough and store for later. 
    - Place aluminum foil over the top of the dough and weigh down with something, i.e. uncooked rice, to imitate the weight of the filling.
    - Bake tart shell until it is mostly cooked, for about 20 minutes, and then remove to cool.
ingredients_list_2:
    - 2 cups spinach, chopped
    - ½ cup sundried tomato, chopped
    - ½ onion, cut into moon-shaped slices
    - 4 strips of bacon
    - 1 cup of mixed swiss / gruyere cheese, shredded
    - 6 eggs
    - 1 cup milk
    - ½ teaspoon thyme
    - ¼ teaspoon fresh nutmeg, grated
    - Sea salt, to taste
    - Ground black pepper, to taste
instructions_list_2:
    - Remove some of the excess bacon fat, but leave some in the pan, because we are going to saute the onion and then the spinach in the same pan, using the flavor from the bacon. 
    - Add the onions and fry for a few minutes until they are slightly browned. Remove from the pan and set aside. 
    - Then throw in the spinach and saute until wilted. Remove from the pan once again. It is important to prepare all three of these ingredients in a frying pan separately, because they each have different cooking times. 
    - In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together. Then add in the rest of the filling -- sundried tomato, spinach, onion, bacon, and shredded cheese. Mix until combined. 
    - Season the quiche filling with salt, pepper, thyme, and fresh grated nutmeg! 
    - Top with some more shredded cheese and place in the oven. Bake for about 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean
    - Let cool for about 15 minutes, cut into slices, and serve warm!

Quiche is like dessert for people who love savory food. Maybe I've said this before, but I definitely prefer savory over sweet. I know, the entire world is against me there. But think about all the cheese you can eat.

And quiche is a great way to eat everything savory all in one. I mean, you can't go wrong with pie crust, eggs, and cheese. And such endless flavor possibilities! Bacon, ham, broccoli, bell peppers, spinach, mushroom, herbs... You can throw whatever you want in there.

The pie crust we used here is made with olive oil instead of butter, and you can hardly tell! Sure butter makes dough flakier, but if you're looking for a fast and simple crust with less calories, this one is the way to go.

We’ve doubled the amount of dough here, just in case your tart or pie dish is slightly taller than the standard. The tart pan we used is pretty tall and we like to have some excess dough just in case anyway. It is really inconvenient if you end up having less dough than you need.

This specific recipe uses nutmeg to flavor the filling, and while you can omit it, we don't recommend doing that. Nutmeg plays a key role here in bringing all the flavors together and adding depth to the flavor profile. Adding just a little bit of nutmeg to your quiche will make it taste infinitely better.

Quiche is just so great for so many reasons. It's portable, reheatable, and a great way to use up leftover veggies. Plus you get to eat food from all your food groups this way.
