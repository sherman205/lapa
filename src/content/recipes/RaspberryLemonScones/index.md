servingSize: "8 scones"
totalTime: "30 minutes"
ingredients:
  - ½ cup frozen raspberries
  - 1 egg
  - ⅓ cup sugar
  - 2 cups flour
  - 1½ teaspoons baking powder
  - 8 tablespoons unsalted frozen butter
  - ½ cup plain yogurt
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - Zest of 1 lemon
  - ½ teaspoon salt
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. 
  - In a medium bowl, mix together the lemon zest and sugar using your fingers. Add in baking powder, flour, and salt and keep mixing.
  - Grate the butter into the flour mixture and use a fork to blend in the butter until everything is well combined.
  - In a separate bowl, whisk together the yogurt, egg, and vanilla until smooth.
  - Add the wet ingredients into the flour mixture and mix until a dough starts to form. You may have to use your hands at this point to press the dough against the bowl as you’re kneading it.
  - Fold in the raspberries gently. They may get crushed a little, but that’s okay!
  - Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it into a circle, about ¾ inch thick. Use a knife to cut the dough like you would a pizza -- into 8 slices.
  - Place the scones on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 15-20 minutes until they start to brown slightly.
  - Let the scones cool and enjoy with some tea!

Scones! I don’t know why but the general thing I hear about scones is that they’re not very exciting and most people don’t look forward to them. Is it the lack of powerful sweetness? Or is it just a boring kind of fruit cake? I’m not sure, because I absolutely love them!

There are so many flavor possibilities and you can even make them savory. And sometimes I just don’t want a sickly sweet chocolate cake. Scones are very refreshing and they still satisfy your sweet tooth craving, so what’s the problem? I definitely like subtle flavors over really powerful hit-you-over-the-head kind of flavor. But that’s just me.

We tried a new technique with these scones -- grating frozen butter. We’ve always seen other bakers doing this method and haven’t gotten around to trying it until now. And I have to say, I think I prefer this method now. You don’t have to wait for your butter to thaw, and grating it is super easy. Plus it gets incorporated into the dough very quickly.

If you like the taste of this citrus dough, you can also try experimenting with other flavors such as blueberry or blackberry!
