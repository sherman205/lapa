So it may appear that there’s a lot going on here; we’ve got fish tacos and mango avocado salsa and a tangy lime cilantro crema to top it off. However, this recipe is not complicated and all these elements work together really nicely to create the ultimate fish taco.

Mango avo salsa has quickly become one of my favorite salsas and the tropical flavors really pair nicely with cod, or any other type of white fish. The lime crema just adds a little bit of sourness to bring the whole enchilada (or taco ☺) together. And not to mention the really healthy and wholesome ingredients at play here.

These flavors remind me of a pleasant, sunny summer day and I imagine that I would invite friends and family over and share with them. And normally that would make me so happy, but then I’m reminded that with the covid-19 craze going on right now, it makes it so difficult to enjoy the little things like this. But I am looking forward to the day when sharing food will be possible again!

We hope you enjoy making and eating these delicious and easy fish tacos. We’re definitely looking forward to summer and more summer flavors!
