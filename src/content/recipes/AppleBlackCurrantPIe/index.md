description: "A tart apple pie but with the colorful punch and flavor of black currants!"
servingSize: "One 9 inch pie"
totalTime: "75 minutes"
ingredients:
    - Pie dough
    - 2 ⅔ cup flour
    - ¾ cup butter, room temperature and cubed
    - 2 tablespoons confectioner’s sugar
    - ¼ cup cold water
    - 1 egg yolk
    - Pinch of salt
    - Pie filling
    - 3 large tart apples
    - 1 cup frozen black currants
    - ⅓ cup sugar
    - 2 tablespoons flour
    - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    - 1 teaspoon lemon zest
    - 1 tablespoon butter
instructions:
    - Use an electric mixer to combine the flour, salt, and butter until the mixture is crumb-like in appearance.
    - Add the confectioner's sugar and continue mixing. 
    - Combine the egg yolk and water in a small bowl and add to the flour mixture. Keep mixing until the dough comes together.
    - Transfer to a lightly floured surface and shape into a ball. 
    - Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. 
    - Roll the pastry ball out on a lightly floured work surface to about a ¼ inch thick. 
    - Line a 9 inch pie pan with the rolled out pie dough, leaving any excess pastry hanging over the edge.
    - Peel, core, and chop the apples. Place them into a medium bowl.
    - Add the black currants, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and lemon zest and toss to coat.
    - Spread the filling into the prepared pie pan and drop pieces of butter on top of the filling. This will give the filling a richer flavor.
    - Trim off any excess pie dough and pinch the edges nicely.
    - Roll the remaining dough out to a ¼ inch thick again to decorate the top of the pie with a lattice or any other pattern you prefer.
    - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
    - Beat an egg in a small bowl and brush over the pastry.
    - Bake for 40 - 45 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and the filling is cooked.
    - Serve warm!

This pie was definitely one of my experiments in the kitchen. Not only had I never made my own homemade pie before, I was experimenting with the flavors again. And this was quite an enjoyable surprise!

I am writing this post a bit after the fact, but this was when I was going through my black currant phase. I had gone to a Russian grocery store in Philly and found these frozen black currants in the freezer section. And boy, was I ecstatic! If you don't know me very well, I get pretty excited about currants of all kinds -- red, black, white, you name it. 
These berries are quite common at farmer's markets across many cities in Europe as far as I've seen. But I'm pretty disappointed that it's really really hard to find fresh currants in the United States. Has anyone else experienced this as well? Or if you know where to reliably find some in the U.S., we would love to know. Please email us the answer -- we would be forever grateful.

If you've never tried fresh currants, I highly recommend that you do, whenever you get a chance. It's such a fascinating flavor, sort of tart and sweet and it makes your mouth feel like it's knitting together (I'm thinking of a Russian word here and I'm not sure if there's an English equivalent).

Anyway, I was putting these black currants into everything I could find. And why not spruce up a plain old apple pie a bit and add some tartness with black currants and lemon. And don't even get me started on the GORGEOUS color. The last thing I expected was for black currants to paint my pie filling a bright red! How lovely!

We hope you enjoy making and eating this amazing pie as much as we did. Let us know how it turns out!
