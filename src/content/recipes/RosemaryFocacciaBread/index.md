description: "A fluffy, lightly-flavored bread that is best served with everything."
servingSize: "One 9 inch circular loaf"
totalTime: "40 minutes"
ingredients:
    - 2 cups flour
    - ⅔ cup warm water
    - ½ teaspoon honey
    - 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
    - ½ teaspoon sea salt
    - 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
    - 1 sprig fresh rosemary, needles only
    - Coarse sea salt and ground black pepper, for topping
instructions:
    - In a large bowl, mix the yeast with warm water and sugar. Let it stand for about 5 minutes, until the yeast gets bubbly. Then stir in the olive oil and salt.
    - Add 1 cup of flour and mix well before adding the second cup of flour. The dough should start to get less sticky. Start kneading the dough, adding more flour if the dough is sticking to your hands. 
    - Work the dough until it has a soft, pliable texture. Roll the dough into a ball and place it into an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for about an hour.
    - Punch the dough down. You can either place it in the fridge for one more rise overnight or bake right away. We usually let the dough rise in the fridge overnight.
    - Press the dough into a circular 9” cake pan to about an inch thick. 
    - Make dimples in the dough with your fingers, spaced uniformly. This prevents the dough from rising too much in the oven and it gives it that nice focaccia look we all know and love.
    - Drizzle some olive oil over the focaccia and season with more coarse sea salt, ground black pepper, and fresh rosemary.
    - Place the cake pan in the oven, preheated at 400 degrees F. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the focaccia is lightly golden brown. A toothpick inserted in the middle should come out completely clean. 
    - Cut into slices or squares and drizzle on some more olive oil before serving.

Comfort food sounds really good right now and I can't think of any comfort better than light, flavorful bread. Bread is the best thing on the planet. But focaccia is probably one of my favorites. Not only is it super easy to make, it is absolutely gorgeous.

What other bread has these cute little dimples splashed across its surface? It's honestly just so fun to poke your fingers into raw dough. Make sure you create deep dimples, otherwise they will disappear when the bread bakes. Don't be afraid to really dig your fingers in!

We usually make this focaccia in a standard 9 inch cake pan, and it goes way too quickly. We should probably start doubling the recipe. So if you know that you're going to eat this in one sitting, make twice as much! You can always freeze the rest if you end up making too much. But who are we kidding -- you can never have too much focaccia.

I love all sorts of flavors of focaccia, but I decided to make this simple rosemary one. Rosemary is such a strong herb that you have to be careful to not add too much, otherwise it will overpower the flavor of the bread. We only use one sprig here to lightly season the loaf and that should be enough!

We will definitely try some other focaccia flavors, so stay tuned! Sun-dried tomato sounds absolutely wonderful, and I'm also tempted to try olive, but I already know what Ryan is going to say about that...

Without further ado, here is the recipe for this simple, healthy-ish rosemary focaccia --  bon appetit!
