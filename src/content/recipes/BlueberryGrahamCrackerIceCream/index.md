description: "An easy-to-make no churn ice cream, flavored with vibrant summer blueberries and bits of graham cracker."
servingSize: "1 quart"
totalTime: "20 minutes"
ingredients:
    - 1 pint fresh blueberries
    - ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
    - ¼ cup sugar
    - 14 oz. sweetened condensed milk
    - 2 cups heavy cream
    - 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
    - 1 cup crushed graham crackers 
instructions:
    - In a medium saucepan, heat the blueberries, cinnamon, and sugar over medium high heat until the jam thickens and all the sugar is dissolved, about 10 minutes or so. Keep stirring constantly to avoid burning. 
    - Let the jam cool slightly and then place in the fridge for about an hour to cool completely.
    - Whisk together the heavy cream and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. 
    - Gently fold in the sweetened condensed milk.
    - Line a loaf pan with parchment paper and pour half of the sweet cream into the bottom of the pan. Scoop some blueberry jam and graham cracker pieces on top. Swirl around with a knife to mix and create a marbled texture. 
    - Repeat this step one more time and pour the rest of the cream mixture on top and add the rest of the blueberry jam and graham crackers on top. Swirl with a knife again.
    - Place in the freezer overnight and enjoy your homemade ice cream the next day!

I have always wanted to make homemade ice cream, but didn't want to invest in a churner. One day, we still might buy a churner and make legit ice cream, but for now, this no churn ice cream is the easiest and tastiest alternative. It tastes exactly like churned ice cream and has the same texture, too!

We love fruity ice cream over really heavy chocolate or coffee flavors, so naturally we had to make this blueberry ice cream in peak blueberry season. And I really like cookies in my ice cream. Some of my favorite ice creams are cookie dough, cookies 'n cream, and so on. Mixing in some graham cracker to our blueberry ice cream made it slightly dressier than just regular blueberry ice cream.

When my parents visited us in Portland, we took them berry picking on Sauvie Island, just 25 minutes outside of downtown. They loved it so much that we had the most difficult time extracting them from the farm to go home! And of course between the four of us, we managed to pick baskets and baskets of blueberries and raspberries.

And so now I'm wondering what to do with it all. And the thought just occurred to me -- we should be making tons and tons of berry ice cream! More blueberry graham cracker ice cream, coming right up!
