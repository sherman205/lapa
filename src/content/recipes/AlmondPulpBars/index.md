This is a great little recipe for when you make homemade almond milk and are left with a ton of almond pulp. I always felt so bad throwing it away. But then again, what can you really make from it? 

Cue these almond pulp bars! Not only are they delicious and healthy, they make use of your leftover almond pulp. And they’re such cute little granola bars that you can take basically anywhere. I individually wrap each one in plastic wrap and pack it in my bag for work!

I didn’t really like using the leftover almond pulp in smoothies or oatmeal as though it were just collagen powder. Instead, adding it to these almond bars actually makes it a key flavor and ingredient. These bars would taste so different without almond pulp as an ingredient. You can, of course, buy almond pulp from the store too. But if you’re like us and make almond milk from scratch, why not use what you already have!
