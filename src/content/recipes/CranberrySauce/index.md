description: "A simple and quick cranberry-orange sauce to go with your Thanksgiving turkey."
servingSize: "16 ounces"
totalTime: "15 minutes"
ingredients:
    - 12 oz. fresh cranberries
    - ½ cup fresh-squeezed orange juice
    - ¾ cup sugar
    - ½ cup water
    - 1 cinnamon stick
    - 1 orange peel
    - Pinch of salt
instructions:
    - Mix together sugar, water, and orange juice and a medium saucepan over medium heat.
    - Add cranberries, cinnamon stick, orange peel, and salt.
    - Bring the cranberries to a simmer, while stirring frequently. Cook until most of the cranberries have popped and the sauce is thick. Leaving a few cranberries whole is definitely okay too if you prefer a chunkier sauce.
    - Let the cranberry sauce cool for about 30 minutes before serving.

I love it when the holidays come around each year, because it means more food and less stress. Thanksgiving is definitely special in the kinds of food we eat and the reminder to give thanks. I haven't always celebrated a traditional Thanksgiving, but I am glad to be doing so nowadays and I am very grateful everyday for where I am in life.

This year has been very special to us -- we moved across the country (me closer to my parents and Ryan further away from his) to a completely new state, got brand new jobs and a brand new house. But at the same time, we haven't lost sight of the old things and what is important to us. This year we shared our table with new friends and amazing food, so that is always a comforting feeling!

On our table we have turkey, stuffing, cornbread, sweet potato casserole, cranberry sauce -- foods we don't eat everyday. I explicitly remember not even liking Thanksgiving food growing up, especially that canned gelatin-like cranberry sauce (yuck!). But every year I look forward to this meal, especially when there's homemade cranberry sauce involved. After figuring out that you can buy fresh cranberries and just make your own, I definitely will always have this on my table every year.

Hope you all had an amazing Thanksgiving with your loved ones. What was your favorite dish at your table?
