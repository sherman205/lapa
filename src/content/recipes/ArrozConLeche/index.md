description: "A refreshing cinnamon rice pudding that can and should be eaten during all times of the year."
servingSize: "4 cups"
totalTime: "45 minutes"
ingredients:
    - 2 cinnamon sticks
    - 2½ cups water
    - 1 cup long-grain rice
    - 1 cup sugar
    - 3½ cups whole milk
    - Salt, to taste
    - Chopped walnuts, for garnish
    - Ground cinnamon, for garnish 
instructions:
    - Heat a pot on the stovetop. Add rice, cinnamon sticks, water, and salt. Mix together and bring to a boil.
    - Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and cover. Cook for about 15 minutes, until most of the water has evaporated. 
    - Add milk, cover and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    - Then add the sugar and cover and cook for another 10 minutes.
    - Remove the lid and continue cooking until the rice has reached a viscous pudding-like consistency.
    - Take the rice off the heat. This will help thicken it even more as it cools. 
    - Serve either hot or cold (we prefer cold!) with toppings of your choice, i.e. chopped walnuts and cinnamon are our favorite.

There is something about rice pudding that is just so comforting. I get so excited knowing there's some in the fridge waiting for me. And cinnamon rice pudding especially -- arroz con leche is just something spectacular. I totally used to think rice can only be eaten in savory dishes, but now I'm never turning back. Bring on the rice desserts!

My grandmother used to make rice pudding for me when I was little. And I loved that one too. It was creamy and sweet and made with full fat milk. But it didn't have cinnamon in it. And that's why arroz con leche reminds me of a fancy version of my grandmother's rice pudding -- close to home, but something completely different at the same time.

And I love that you can use rice and achieve this flavor by either making arroz con leche or horchata. I still haven't decided which one I like better. Sometimes I'm in a rice pudding kind of mood and other times I'm in a rice drink mood. This recipe is so good and so simple, you'll be making it all the time!
