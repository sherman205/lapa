servingSize: "2 servings"
totalTime: "20 minutes"
ingredients:
    - 5 eggs
    - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
    - 1 tablespoon milk
    - Sea salt, to taste
    - Ground black pepper, to taste
instructions:
    - Crack the eggs in an unheated saucepan. Turn the stovetop on to medium low heat and use a rubber spatula to start mixing the eggs. Add in the butter once the eggs have combined.
    - Continue stirring the eggs slowly and constantly until they come together, about 10 minutes. Don’t stop stirring otherwise the eggs will burn and won’t be as creamy.
    - Once the eggs have started to resemble creamy curds, take the pan off the heat every 2 minutes and continue stirring until the scrambled eggs look fluffy.
    - Add in the milk and stir until absorbed. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. 
    - Top with fresh herbs if desired and serve immediately!

I am so lucky that Ryan knows how to make some really bomb scrambled eggs. It’s such a treat when he makes them for breakfast. They’re absolutely perfect on toast because they lie in one big fluffy pile and don’t fall off when I bite into the bread.

I don’t know why but I’m just so bad at making scrambled eggs! I always end up burning part of it or they’re too soggy. But don’t worry, this recipe is tried and true. And I’ve taste tested it more times than I can count.

So if you’ve also been having a hard time getting your scrambled eggs to come out perfect, give this recipe a try. The trick is to never stop stirring. And rubber spatulas are your best friend :) If you get worried that you’ll burn the eggs, make sure you keep the pan on low heat and keep taking the eggs off the stovetop and back on again.

You’ll become an egg master in no time!
