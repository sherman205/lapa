description: "Topped with cashews and an olive oil drizzle, this eggplant spread is the perfect appetizer for your table."
servingSize: "Serves 2 people"
totalTime: "30 minutes"
ingredients:
    - 2 small eggplants, washed and unpeeled
    - 2 tablespoons tahini
    - 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
    - 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
    - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
    - Olive oil drizzle
    - Handful of chopped cashews
    - Pinch of sea salt
    - Pinch of ground black pepper
instructions:
    - Wash and wrap each of the eggplants in aluminum foil. Turn on a stovetop burner to low heat and place them directly onto the burner. 
    - Heat the eggplants for about 15-20 minutes on the stovetop, or until they are soft and start to smoke a little. Make sure to rotate them halfway through to make they get cooked on both sides.
    - Let the eggplants completely cool before peeling the skin off (they will be hot!). You can either stick them in the fridge overnight and do this the next morning or wait an hour or so. 
    - Once the eggplants are cooled, peel the skin with a paring knife and finely chop. Then make a smooth paste by using an immersion blender or a food processor.
    - Transfer the eggplant to a bowl and add the minced garlic, tahini, mayonnaise, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
    - Top with a drizzle of olive oil, more ground pepper, and chopped cashews. 
    - Serve with pita chips or warm flatbread!

I'm sure by now you've maybe heard of baba ganoush. And if you haven't, now is the perfect time to try it! It's super easy to make at home. Out of all the middle eastern style dips, this one is probably my favorite. I know, hummus is pretty good too, but this one is just something special.

Baba ganoush is a traditional Lebanese side dish or appetizer, made with roasted eggplant, tahini, olive oil, and different spices. We like to think of it as being part of the hummus family. And it is absolutely perfect with pita chips.

When I'm out at a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant, I always try to order my meal with soft pita and an assortment of baba ganoush, hummus, and garlic dip. It's always fun and delicious to have all those options!

I remember there was this one small Mediterranean place about a 5 minutes drive from my parent's house in California and I really liked it because they not only had the best baba ganoush, they also had dang good hummus and garlic sauce. And you can order a ton of it! I haven't been to a place that serves all three so it was amazing. I miss that place.

And speaking of amazing baba ganoush... the most important part of this recipe is to smoke the eggplant just right. The way to do this is to roast the eggplant over a flame with its skin still on. This gives it the smoky flavor we know and love. Once the eggplant is cooled, then you can peel the skin off, mash it, and season it.

When I first saw my dad roasting an eggplant over the flame on our gas stove, I thought it was the funniest thing ever. But there is a method to the madness. I'm thinking this would probably be amazing roasted over a bonfire flame.

We hope you enjoy this simple recipe as much as we do. Let us know how it turns out, of course!
