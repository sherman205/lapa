description: "A sweet sweet heart attack waiting to happen. Complete with cotton candy fluff, sprinkles, ice cream, and tons of pizazz!"
servingSize: "2 16-oz. mason jars"
totalTime: "20 minutes"
ingredients:
    - 3 cups old-fashioned vanilla ice cream
    - 1 cup milk
    - 2 tablespoons sprinkles 
    - 8 oz. semi-sweet baking chocolate bar, chopped
    - Several tufts of multi-colored cotton candy
instructions:
    - In a blender, blend together the ice cream and milk until the milkshake is creamy and somewhat thick. Depending on your taste, you can choose to have a runnier milkshake or a thicker milkshake. Just add more ice cream or milk depending on your preference.
    - To create a festive chocolate dipped rim for your mason jars, melt the chocolate. Place the chopped chocolate in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir frequently with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is melted. 
    - Remove the metal bowl of chocolate from the heat. Dip the mason jar rims into the chocolate and swirl. Sprinkle some sprinkles over the chocolate so that they can set. 
    - Let the chocolate-dipped mason jars cool for about 5 minutes in the freezer or until the chocolate is solidified. 
    - Pour the milkshake into the jars and top with cotton candy fluff. Serve with more sprinkles and party!

Not sure what was running through my mind here, but I wanted this to be the most extra milkshake we would attempt to make at home. We're all about eating healthy and wholesome, but sometimes it's okay to splurge, right?

I randomly got a bag of cotton candy at work and was really worried about what to do with it. I was thinking of ways I could use cotton candy in our cooking. I didn't want to just eat an entire bag of cotton candy -- I had to do something with it! I googled this a bit and saw that many people use cotton candy as toppers for cupcakes and cookies and cocktails. And then I thought, "why not top a milkshake?" It seemed to me that the flavors would combine perfectly -- creamy milkshakes and sugary cotton candy.

I had this vision of what I wanted this milkshake to look like and taste like. And I'm so pleased to say that it worked out! I never thought that cotton candy would taste so good with a milkshake. And that the texture would supplement it so well.

This a sugar heart attack waiting to happen. I'm not much of a sweets person -- that's definitely more Ryan than me. And I was definitely done after drinking one of these. But it was so pretty and I'm glad we have photos of these sugary milkshakes so that I can keep staring at them.

Go ahead and try this out if you're feeling bold. These milkshakes definitely do not disappoint. Oh, and don't forget the sprinkles!
