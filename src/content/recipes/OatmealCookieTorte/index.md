servingSize: "4 mini tortes"
totalTime: "30 minutes"
list_1: "Cognac buttercream"
list_2: "Assembling the torte"
ingredients:
  - 25 oz. oatmeal cookies
  - 1 teaspoon cacao powder 
  - 2 tablespoons Cognac
  - ½ cup crushed walnuts
  - 10.5 oz. sweetened condensed milk
  - 8 oz. unsalted butter, softened
  - ½ cup milk
instructions:
  - In a medium sized bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the butter until it is uniform and smooth.
  - Slowly add small amounts of condensed milk while continuing to mix.
  - Add the cocoa powder and Cognac and continue mixing until smooth and creamy.
instructions_list_2:
  - Pour the milk into a bowl and submerge each oatmeal cookie to soften it slightly before placing it at the bottom of a small 4” trifle bowl (or other glass jar). Continue doing this to form a layer, crumbling the cookies to fill any gaps.
  - To make the next layer, use a spoon to spread the buttercream over the oatmeal cookie layer.
  - Continue building the torte by alternating oatmeal cookie layers and buttercream layers until you fill the trifle bowl. The last layer should be a buttercream layer.
  - Sprinkle the chopped walnuts on top of the torte.
  - Place the torte in the fridge for about 2 hours to allow it to set.
  - Serve chilled and enjoy!

Another childhood favorite, here we go! I have to admit something here first, I kind of don’t like cake… At least the kind of cake everyone pictures when they think of cake, like birthday cake. Basically that fluffy “cake” part, which I like to refer to as “sweet bread” instead because I don’t really know how else to describe it. My friends all think I’m crazy. Anyway…

The reason I bring this up is because this “cake” is actually more of a torte, but some people don’t realize there’s a pretty big difference and have never even heard of the word “torte” before. So a traditional cake recipe is made from sugar, eggs, butter, and flour. A torte usually has no flour and uses nuts or crumbs (hence the oatmeal and nuts we use in this recipe).

Also tortes are much more dense, in taste and in texture. Which is why I love this torte so much! Absolutely delicious. And it’s a family recipe but I guess the secret is out now :)

We’ve tried to make it in several different shapes and forms now to see how it would look the best. The recipe below is for the traditional style, where you would build the torte on a plate. We realized pretty quickly that you can still achieve the same beautiful layers in a trifle pudding cup and the overall effect is much nicer, I’d say.

Whichever way you do it, as long as you achieve layers of oatmeal cookie and cognac buttercream, it really doesn’t matter what it looks like. Have fun!
