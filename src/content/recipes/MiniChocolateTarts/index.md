We don’t make a ton of vegan dishes at home normally, since we both can’t completely cut out dairy. Mainly because of the cheese. Cheese is life!! But other than that, we would probably give it up completely.

But I digress. I didn’t feel like making a traditional tart shell for this recipe, because I didn’t feel like rolling out the dough, ugh. Tbh, vegan-based tart crusts are suuuper easy because you just have to press the mixture into the tart shell. No rolling pin required! 

So I experimented with an oat crust because oats are yum. And it’s so good! Sweet and kind of like a cookie. So that works for me! The rest of the ingredients fell into place. Sometimes I hate using sugar too, because I feel like it’s super unhealthy and processed. So I was going to use agave. And at that point, I was like “I should probably just make this vegan-friendly” while I’m at it.

The chocolate is the best part though! So rich and thick and vegan sceptics would never be able to tell it’s actually vegan. So add this to your to-do-list because you’re gonna want to make this. Also, if you have leftover chocolate filling, it is PERFECT to use in a sandwich cookie, just sayin’.
