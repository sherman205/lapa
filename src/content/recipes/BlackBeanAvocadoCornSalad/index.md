We love this salad, because it's simple to make and tastes absolutely amazing! With only 3 main ingredients, this takes only a few minutes to throw together. And the dressing is to die for, I could probably put it on anything. So if you happen to try this dressing on other salads, let us know how it goes!

We have Ryan's mom to thank for this creation -- I couldn't stop eating this the first time I tried it. And it makes for such a refreshing meal in the summer. Southwestern style salads are one of my absolute favorites, so maybe that's why I'm so addicted.

The cayenne in the dressing blends really well with the honey and lime, so you don't even feel the spiciness. We have a huge bottle of dried cayenne at home, which we rarely use. It's pretty sad, really, but this is one of those few times we whip it out. We haven't been used to spicy food, so we've always been hesitant to cook with it. But if you're worried about spice, you don't have to worry about that with this dressing. You could reduce the amount of cayenne if you want, but we don't recommend taking it out of the dressing completely.

It is best to prepare this salad immediately before serving, since avocado obviously has a tendency to turn brown over time. We still eat this even after it's been in the fridge for a few days, just because it's that good. But for peak freshness, we recommend eating it right away.
