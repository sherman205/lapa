servingSize: "One 9 inch cheesecake"
totalTime: "1 hour 30 minutes"
list_1: "Cheesecake"
list_2: "Marionberry Sauce"
ingredients:
    - 1½ cups graham crackers, crumbled
    - 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
    - ½ teaspoon cinnamon
    - 4 8-ounce blocks cream cheese
    - ½ cup sour cream
    - 3 large eggs
    - 2 tablespoons flour
    - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    - ½ teaspoon lemon zest
    - Salt to taste
instructions:
    - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Add in cinnamon and a pinch of salt and stir until combined.
    - Press the graham cracker mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan.
    - Bake for about 10 minutes, and remove to cool, reducing the oven temperature to 325 degrees F.
    - In a large bowl, mix the cream cheese and sugar using an electric mixer. Add in the sour cream, flour, vanilla, lemon zest, and a pinch of salt. Beat until just combined. Add the eggs in one by one until the batter is smooth and creamy.
    - Pour the batter into the springform pan over the graham cracker crust.
    - Drop teaspoons of the marionberry sauce all over the cheesecake and use a chopstick to swirl the sauce around, creating a design of your choosing.
    - In order to prevent the cheesecake from cracking, make a bath. Place the springform pan in a roasting pan and pour hot water into the roasting pan halfway up the springform pan and place in the oven.
    - Bake the cheesecake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until it has just set and slightly jiggles.
    - Let the cheesecake cool in its water bath for about 30 minutes, and then remove the springform pan from the roasting pan. Run a knife along the sides of the springform pan and place it in the fridge to cool completely.
    - After the cheesecake has cooled, remove it from its pan.
    - Serve a thick cheesecake slice with a healthy serving of warm marionberry sauce.

It was national cheesecake day a few days ago, and naturally we missed it. Do people just keep track of all the national food days and plan out which food they're going to make? That sounds both exhausting, yet easy at the same time.

On the one hand, you basically have a preset menu telling you which national food day is coming up, thus dictating what you should make next. On the other hand,  checking that food calendar and planning your life out like that leaves no room for creativity and life's natural bumps in the road.

Regardless, we are bringing you this AMAZING cheesecake. Pretty simple to make, yet if you want to dress it up, this marionberry sauce is to die for. If you've never heard of marionberries before, we hadn't either until we moved to Oregon.

The marionberry can basically be considered the state berry, and is a cross between two types of blackberries. Marionberries are larger than blackberries and have a fairly complex flavor profile -- tart, earthy, and sweet. They make for great sauces and jams!

It may be unlikely that you find marionberries in the grocery store, especially if you live outside Oregon, but it you happen to find some, you should try making this marionberry sauce. We went berry-picking on a local farm to get ours, and that was also a fun experience (though we had to beware of thorns; I still have battle scars from picking my way through some of the bushes).

You can always substitute the marionberries with blackberries or raspberries, but no matter whether you choose to go sauceless or not, this cheesecake is simple and delicious. It'll satisfy your sweet tooth for sure!
