servingSize: "4 servings"
totalTime: "1 hour"
ingredients:
  - 4 red bell peppers
  - 8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
  - 2 tablespoons butter
  - 3 garlic cloves, grated
  - 1½ cups risotto rice
  - ½ medium onion, roughly chopped
  - 1½ cups cherry tomatoes, halved
  - 4 cups vegetable broth, warm
  - ½ cup dry white wine
  - ½ cup grated parmesan cheese
  - 4 sprigs thyme, leaves only
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh basil, for topping
  - Sea salt, to taste
  - Ground black pepper, to taste
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise, keeping the stems attached, and clean out the seeds. Place the bell peppers open side up in a baking dish and drizzle with olive oil and sea salt. Bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until they are softened and roasted through.
  - In a large saucepan, add 1 tablespoon of butter and sauté the mushrooms with some salt until they’re soft and start releasing some moisture, then set them aside.
  - Heat another tablespoon of butter over medium heat in the same saucepan. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about a minute. Add in the garlic and stir together.
  - Add in the halved cherry tomatoes and cook until they are soft and start to pop. Sprinkle in the thyme leaves as well.
  - Add in the rice and stir with a wooden spoon until the rice is coated, then pour in the white wine. Continue stirring until the wine is absorbed and then add 2 cups of warm vegetable broth and cook until that is absorbed as well. Pour in the remaining 2 cups of broth and stir continuously to prevent the risotto from burning. Mix in the cooked mushrooms.
  - Cook until the risotto is creamy and has absorbed the liquid. Turn off the heat and mix in the parmesan cheese.
  - Spoon some risotto into each of the bell pepper halves and top with fresh basil. Serve immediately.

It’s been getting pretty difficult to come up with creative and delicious meal ideas these days, since every meal we eat is cooked at home now (except the occasional takeout delivery we order). Sometimes we resort to just eating PB&J’s or cereal as a meal. Nothing wrong with that of course, but when inspiration strikes to make a beautiful dish such as these risotto stuffed peppers, you just gotta follow through!

We’ve been trying to come up with more meal recipes so that you guys also get inspired to cook something for lunch or dinner. And because there’s only so much dessert we can make with just the two of us stuck in the house all day. Trying not to gain too much weight here.

I just love a good risotto (especially mushroom risotto) and I wanted to try adding some tomatoes in and it came out amazing! This risotto pairs extremely well with the oven-roasted red bell peppers and maybe even with some wine. And it’s super easy to make! You just roast some bell peppers in the oven and fill them with this one-pot risotto. Give it a try if you’re feeling like you’ve run out of ideas for dinner!
