Here is another easy pasta dish you can make on a weeknight, especially if you're pressed for time. We like to make this on Sunday nights sometimes, so that we have some meals for the week, too. And it is so quick! After boiling some tortellini (we always buy Kirkland Five Cheese Tortellini from Costco), all you have to do is toss everything together and you're done. No extra cooking required.

This dish is pretty light, too. There aren't any heavy sauces to keep you full and bloated. All the seasoning comes from some parmesan, olive oil, and salt and pepper. That's why we also like to think of this pasta dish as a salad. If we have leftovers, we don't even bother heating it up. We eat it cold, like a pasta salad. And it is perfect in the cold winter or the hot summer.

Going back to that Kirkland Five Cheese Tortellini I mentioned before... These are the best tortellini out there if you aren't planning on making your own from scratch. We've tried a lot of brands of tortellini from the grocery stores, but none of them have quite the salty, cheesy taste that Costco's does.

First of all, like most store-bought pasta, a lot of bagged or boxed tortellini is dry. And they seem to seriously lack a lot of flavor. They're just all sort of bland and no one likes that, right? Kirkland tortellini has a pretty salty cheese filling and it works well with this tortellini dish, because we're not adding too many sauces or flavorings. Next time you're at Costco, make sure you try it out -- you won't regret it.

Of course, you can always make your own tortellini. Because there's nothing better than making things yourself!
